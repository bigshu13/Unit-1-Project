Psuedocode 
//8x8 column row board
// I need 12 pieces different color to put on each side of the board.
// I want the pieces to set on the black spaces of the board. 
// I need the pieces to take out the opposite color pieces when they cross over. 
// need to put a rule to turn the checkers piece into a king piece when it reaches to the otherside of the board.
// an img of a king crown should pop up on the piece that makes it to the otherside.
// change moving rules for king pieces so they can move multiple spaces and move backwards. 
// make sure normal pieces move one space at a time diagonally.
// when pieces get taken i want them to move to trash area on side of the board. 
// need to have play again button when game is over.
// need to add win condtion when all pieces are taken.
// need to add "i quit" button when player gives up.
// need to make sure pieces can jump multiple opponent pieces if needed.
// make sure pieces cant go to red boxes. 

Favorite function is resetBorder.

biggest challenge was doing the functions in javascript and trying to make them work

key learnings/takeaways 
is that i chose a game that was way out of my league. i didnt know it would be so difficult to make a checkers game.
